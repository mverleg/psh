psh

Psh is a mix of Python and shell. It adds some tricks to standard Python 3, to make it more convenient as a replacement for shell scripts.

USAGE:
    [-v][-h] /path/script.psh --name=value

The command has three parts: options, a script name, and environment values.

OPTIONS:
    -v           Use verbose mode, which shows more information.
    -h/--help  Display this help information, then exit.

SCRIPT:
    The absolute or relative path to the .psh script to execute.
    Scripts will be searched in the current working directory,
      and in the path given by environment variable PSH_PATH.

ENVIRONMENT:
    These are name-value pairs, which will be passed to the .pth script.
    Format is one of
        --name value
        --name=value
