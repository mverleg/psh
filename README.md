Psh
===============================

Psh is a mix of Python and shell. It add some tricks to standard Python 3, to make it more suitable as a replacement for shell scripts.

Features include:

* Get argument values from different sources with `?`
* Call external commands easily with `$`
* Built-in utilities to prevent boilerplate.

Examples

Will be added later! Maybe!
